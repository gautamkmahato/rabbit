You're off to a great start — what you're building is like "AI-assisted GitHub PR/code review intelligence as a service", and it has real potential. Since you already have:

✅ Repo listing

✅ Commit listing

✅ File diffs

✅ PR fetching

✅ LLM-based code review

Here's a breakdown of strategic, high-impact features you can add to become a truly valuable developer/engineering tool:

🧠 AI-Driven Core Enhancements
Summarize the Entire Pull Request

Generate a high-level summary of what the PR changes and why.

Help reviewers quickly understand context.

Use diff and PR description as input to LLM.

Review Suggestions by Category

Categorize comments: "Security", "Code Quality", "Best Practices", "Performance".

Allow filtering comments in UI by type.

PR Risk Level Analysis

Assign a risk level (Low, Medium, High) based on:

Number of files/lines changed

Complexity of changes (e.g. regex, cryptography, async)

LLM-Generated Unit Test Suggestions

Suggest unit tests for newly added/modified functions.

Great for legacy codebases or lazy dev teams 😄

🧪 Developer Experience Features
Inline Review Comments Simulation

Mimic GitHub's inline review style with AI comments next to code lines.

Show AI feedback exactly where changes happened.

File-by-File AI Review Toggle

Let users expand/collapse LLM reviews per file to reduce noise.

Diff Comparison Between Any Two Commits

Let users compare arbitrary commits and generate AI feedback.

📊 Analytics & Insights
PR Review Analytics Dashboard

Average review time, common issues, reviewer bottlenecks.

Which files frequently cause bugs? Which authors need guidance?

AI Reviewer Activity Timeline

Track when AI reviewed which PRs, visualize team productivity aided by AI.

Code Quality Scorecard (per repo or PR)

Rate PRs or repos based on:

Linting

Test coverage (if integrated with codecov)

LLM review quality

🛡️ Team and Collaboration Features
Multi-user Workspaces / Teams

Invite teammates.

Shared dashboard, access-controlled reviews.

Slack or Discord Integration

Post AI PR reviews directly into a team’s channel.

Review Assignments with AI Prioritization

Suggest which PRs need urgent review.

Assign to best-fit reviewer based on historical contributions.

⚙️ Workflow Automation
Auto-label PRs (bug, refactor, docs, etc.)

Based on diff and PR title/description.

CI/CD Integration Suggestions

If no tests are run on PRs, recommend integrating GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.

🔐 Security/Compliance Suggestions (Enterprise Tier)
Static Analysis Overlay

Use LLM + static rules to flag secrets, credentials, unsafe patterns.

Sensitive Function Detection

Alert if someone uses eval, exec, or modifies auth logic.

🛠️ Dev Tools Integrations
Browser Extension (Review PRs Inline on GitHub)

Inject AI suggestions directly into GitHub’s UI.

CLI Tool

npx your-tool review for local reviews in terminal.

VSCode Extension

Live review suggestions as developers write code.
